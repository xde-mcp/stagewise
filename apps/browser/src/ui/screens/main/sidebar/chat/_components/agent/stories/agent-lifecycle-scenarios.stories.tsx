Then, I can explain the differences.\n\nI think that I already know the answer, but I want to be sure. So, if a prop is passed to a component, it is read-only and cannot be changed by the component. If a state is changed, the component will re-render with the new state.\n\nLet me think through some concrete examples. When a parent component passes a prop to a child, that prop is immutable from the child's perspective. The child can only read it and use it to render or pass it further down the component tree. Any attempt to modify a prop directly would violate React's unidirectional data flow pattern.\n\nState, on the other hand, is managed within a component using hooks like useState. When state changes, React automatically re-renders that component and its children with the new values. This is how components become interactive - users can click buttons, fill forms, and trigger state updates that cause the UI to update.\n\nAnother key difference is the source of truth. Props come from outside the component, so the parent is the source of truth for prop values. State is owned by the component itself, making the component the source of truth for state values. This is important for understanding data flow in React applications.\n\nI should also mention that props are useful for customizing component behavior and appearance, while state is used for tracking user interactions and internal component logic. Props enable component reusability and composition, while state enables component interactivity and responsiveness.",

      responseText: `# Comprehensive Guide to Building Accessible Web Applications

Accessibility (often abbreviated as a11y) is the practice of making your websites and applications usable by as many people as possible. This includes users with disabilities, users on slow connections, and users with older devices.

## 1. Semantic HTML

The foundation of accessibility starts with semantic HTML. Using the right HTML elements for their intended purpose provides built-in accessibility benefits.

### Headings
Use heading levels (h1-h6) hierarchically. Don't skip levels—go from h1 to h2, not h1 to h3. Each page should have exactly one h1 that describes the main content.

### Landmarks
Use semantic landmark elements like \`<header>\`, \`<nav>\`, \`<main>\`, \`<aside>\`, and \`<footer>\`. Screen readers can navigate between these landmarks, making it easier for users to find content.

### Lists
Use \`<ul>\`, \`<ol>\`, and \`<dl>\` for lists. Screen readers announce the number of items in a list, helping users understand the content structure.

## 2. Keyboard Navigation

All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible. Users should be able to navigate your entire application using only a keyboard.

### Focus Management
- Ensure all interactive elements can receive focus
- Use visible focus indicators (don't remove \`outline\` without providing an alternative)
- Manage focus when opening/closing modals and dialogs
- Use \`tabindex="0"\` to make non-interactive elements focusable when needed
- Avoid \`tabindex\` values greater than 0

### Skip Links
Provide "skip to main content" links at the top of pages so keyboard users can bypass repetitive navigation.

## 3. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

ARIA attributes provide additional context to assistive technologies when semantic HTML alone isn't sufficient.

### Common ARIA Attributes
- \`aria-label\`: Provides an accessible name for an element
- \`aria-labelledby\`: References another element that labels this one
- \`aria-describedby\`: References an element that describes this one
- \`aria-hidden="true"\`: Hides content from assistive technologies
- \`aria-live\`: Announces dynamic content changes

### ARIA Roles
Use roles sparingly—prefer semantic HTML. Common roles include:
- \`role="button"\` for elements that act as buttons but aren't \`<button>\`
- \`role="alert"\` for important messages
- \`role="dialog"\` for modal dialogs

**Remember the first rule of ARIA: Don't use ARIA if you can use semantic HTML instead.**

## 4. Color and Contrast

Visual design significantly impacts accessibility.

### Contrast Ratios
- Regular text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold): minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- UI components and graphics: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

### Don't Rely on Color Alone
Never use color as the only way to convey information. Add text labels, icons, or patterns to ensure colorblind users can understand the content.

## 5. Images and Media

All non-text content needs text alternatives.

### Alt Text
- Provide descriptive alt text for informational images
- Use empty alt (\`alt=""\`) for decorative images
- For complex images (charts, diagrams), provide detailed descriptions

### Videos
- Include captions for all video content
- Provide audio descriptions for visual-only information
- Include transcripts for audio content

## 6. Forms

Forms are often the most challenging area for accessibility.

### Labels
Every form input must have an associated label. Use the \`<label>\` element with the \`for\` attribute matching the input's \`id\`.

### Error Handling
- Clearly identify errors in form submissions
- Provide helpful error messages near the relevant fields
- Use \`aria-invalid\` and \`aria-describedby\` to associate error messages with inputs

### Required Fields
- Indicate required fields visually and programmatically
- Use \`aria-required="true"\` or the HTML5 \`required\` attribute

## 7. Testing for Accessibility

Regular testing is essential for maintaining accessibility.

### Automated Testing
- Use tools like axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse
- Integrate accessibility checks into your CI/CD pipeline
- Note: Automated tools catch only about 30-40% of issues

### Manual Testing
- Navigate your entire app using only a keyboard
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
- Test at various zoom levels (up to 200%)
- Disable CSS and verify content order makes sense

### User Testing
- Include users with disabilities in your testing process
- Conduct usability testing with assistive technologies

## 8. Common Patterns

### Modal Dialogs
- Trap focus within the modal when open
- Return focus to the trigger element when closed
- Close on Escape key press
- Use \`role="dialog"\` and \`aria-modal="true"\`

### Dropdown Menus
- Use \`aria-expanded\` to indicate open/closed state
- Use \`aria-haspopup\` to indicate menu presence
- Support arrow key navigation within the menu

### Tabs
- Use \`role="tablist"\`, \`role="tab"\`, and \`role="tabpanel"\`
- Support arrow key navigation between tabs
- Use \`aria-selected\` to indicate the active tab

## Conclusion

Building accessible applications benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities. It improves SEO, mobile usability, and overall user experience. Start with semantic HTML, test regularly, and continuously improve. Accessibility is not a one-time task but an ongoing commitment to inclusive design.

Remember: The web is for everyone. Let's build it that way.`,

Git merge goes sideways
Conflicts bloom like spring flowers
Resolve, commit, pray

Future self will thank me now
Or curse my vague words

Then suddenly—clarity!
Solution was simple

Functions flow like poetry
Art meets engineering
