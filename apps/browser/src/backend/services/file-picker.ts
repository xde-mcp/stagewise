/**
 * This file contains a file picker service that other services may use to request the user to select a file or directory.
 * We implement this on our own, because there is literally no proper directory picker lib in the node ecosystem and the browser doesn't offer clear paths.
 * Electron offers something, but we don't use electron (for now), so...
 *
 * The way this works is:
 * - When a request comes in, we update the UI through karton to show a file picker dialog with the configured title, description etc.
 * - The initial directory is the working directory of the app.
 * - The user can jump between folders etc. and either create new folders or select files (bsed on handlers for karton procedures).
 * - Whenever the user changes directory, we update the UI through karton to show the new directory.
 * - When new requests come in while the current request is still active, they are queued up.
 * - The user ay dismiss a request at any time, which should lead to a Exception being thrown and the request being closed. ("UserDismissedRequestException").
 * - When a request is either closed or dismissed, we respond to the request with the result and update the UI to not show the request anymore.
 * - When other requests exists in the queue, they are rendered 200ms after the last request was either closed or dismissed.
